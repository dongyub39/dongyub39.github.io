    "description": "This paper introduces control algorithms aimed at improving the stability of a mobile cable-driven parallel robot (MCDPRs), consisting of four mobile platforms and eight cables during motion. The algorithms include cable length control (CLC), tension distribution algorithm (TDA), path curvature-based localization (CBL), and adaptive velocity control (AVC)."
